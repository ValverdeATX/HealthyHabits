# Healthy Habits
Project Name: Healthy Habits Program (Phase One)

Authors: Theo K. Valverde, Charlie Cox

Texas State University

This was a project written for a Software Engineering class taught by Professor Ted Lehr.
Although this project was originally designed to be divided among five members,
one member opted into dropping out and two others did not have the time to contribute.
Therefore this work is representative of the two remaining member's efforts (Theo and Charlie).

The goal of Phase One was to create a program that roughly conveyed the idea of giving the user
a space where they could write down and keep track of how well they were maintaining good habits
and getting rid of bad habits through a certain period of time.

How to run:
1) Initialize JAVA IDE (written on Eclipse)
2) Begin the program from SystemLog.java (located in the systemLogin package)
